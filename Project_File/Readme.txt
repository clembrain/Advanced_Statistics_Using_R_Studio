Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction

Overview
This project aims to predict the compressive strength of concrete based on its composition and other influencing factors. 
The dataset contains variables such as cement content, water, superplasticizers, age, and supplementary materials like fly ash and blast furnace slag. 
Various statistical and machine learning methods, including linear regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost, 
are used to explore the relationships between the components of concrete and its compressive strength.

Key Features
- Comprehensive Analysis: This project explores classical regression techniques alongside advanced machine learning models 
such as XGBoost to predict concrete compressive strength.
- Multivariate Relationships: The models examine how different concrete ingredients and their combinations affect compressive strength.
- Model Evaluation: Models are assessed using performance metrics like R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error).

Setup Instructions

   - Clone the repository using "git clone" or download the ZIP file and extract it.

2. Install Required Libraries:
   Ensure that all necessary libraries for running the analysis are installed in your R environment.

3. Load Data:
   Load the dataset into R to begin analysis. The dataset should be in Excel format or another compatible format.

4. Run the Analysis:
   Once the data is loaded, run the statistical models to predict compressive strength. 
The models include linear regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

Acknowledgments
This work builds on earlier studies, particularly Yeh (1998) and Yeh (2006), 
who demonstrated the importance of factors such as cement content and curing age on concrete strength. 
Recent developments in machine learning have been integrated to better understand the complex relationships in the data.
